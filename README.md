# autocomplete

In this repo we will see how can we predict/complete the next word based on some of the previous words. It's use we can see how we see sugestions on our keyboard when we start typing. 


Here in this work we have used  RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks). Why RNN here, because they give advantage of one important thing that is MEMORY. In other words RNNs provide to compute the current input but also the input which was provided in the previous step.
